HURWITZ #20029<br /><br />On 10/04/2020, at approximately 2224 hrs, I responded to a reported single-vehicle traffic collision on S Himalaya St and E Chenango Ave. A refused RP stated that a vehicle had crashed ""at the S curve"" on Himalaya St, just south of Chenango. This RP said a person, unknown if male or female, had gotten out of the vehicle's driver seat and began to walk northbound on S Himalaya St. Deputy Gryniewicz, and I arrived 2230 hrs.</p><p>Deputy Gryniewicz began to try to find the driver who had fled the accident scene. I immediately went to the vehicle and found it to be unoccupied. It was a gray Chevrolet Traverse CO/1837070 - Temp. The car was facing south in northbound lanes. The car was in both the number one and number two lanes. There was damage to a retaining wall located on the east side of S Himalaya St. The vehicle was leaning partially against the retaining wall. There were no keys in the ignition, and the vehicle was locked. I noticed moderate damage to the left front fender and bumper. There was also minor damage to the hood of the vehicle. There was no airbag deployment in the car. As I walked around the vehicle, I saw that the rear tires were pointed in towards each other.<br /><br />Deputy Gryniewicz, as well as several other deputies, returned to the crash scene, after not being able to find the driver of the vehicle. 1st Class Towing was advised and responded to the scene. After 1st Class Towing arrived, an individual walked up to our patrol cars. The person, identified by there Colorado Drivers License as JASSIR, SALVADOR - 07/14/1989, stated he was driving the vehicle north on S Himalaya St when he ""lost control"" and slammed into the wall. Salvador could not give me any clear description of what ""losing control"" meant. I asked Salvador if he had been drinking, to which he replied no. I asked Salvador if he would be willing to participate in voluntary Standard Field Sobriety Maneuvers. He did. Salvador completed all maneuvers appropriately, and there were no signs of alcohol intoxication on his person. I issued Salvador a citation for Careless Driving and Fleeing the Scene of a Crash.&nbsp;<br /><br />Nothing further.&nbsp;<br /><br />AC20-0015759 - 10/10/2020<br />M. HURWITZ #20029</p>"
